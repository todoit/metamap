TI  - Triple-negative breast cancer: an update on neoadjuvant clinical trials.
PG  - 385978
AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive malignancy with a poor
      prognosis despite the high rates of response to chemotherapy. This scenario
      highlights the need to develop novel therapies and/or treatment strategies to
      reduce the mortality associated with TNBC. The neoadjuvant setting provides a
      model for rapid assessment of treatment efficacy with smaller patient accruals
      and over shorter periods of time compared to the traditional adjuvant setting. In
      addition, a clear surrogate endpoint of improved survival, known as pathologic
      complete response, already exists in this setting. Here, we review current data
      from completed and ongoing neoadjuvant clinical trials for TNBC.
